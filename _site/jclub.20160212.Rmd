<!-- Add more general background page on use of LDL for screening/medication-->

## Background (1)

* Recommendation for universal LDL-C screening in children 17-21 years and statin treatment for high risk individuals 
    * Different reccomendations for this age group given two different guidelines.
    * These differences can cause confusion.

## Background (2)

| | 2011 | 2013 | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| |National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents |  American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults |
| Without risk factors | LDL $\ge$ 190 mg/dL | LDL $\ge$ 190 mg/dL |
| **With** comorbid risk factors ( hypertension, tobacco use, and obesity) | LDL $\ge$ 130 or LDL $\ge$ 160 mg/dL | LDL $\ge$ 190 mg/dL |


## Background (3)

* What are the high-level pediatric risk factors?
    * High blood pressure
    * High BMI
    * Smoking
    * Diabetes Mellitus
  
* What are the moderate-level pediatric risk factors?
    * Blood pressure
    * BMI
    * HDL-C

## Study Aim

There are discrepancies between the two guidelines for people who transition to adulthood, ages 17 to 21 years.

* What proportion of people would meet the criteria for each of the guidelines?


## Methods (1) -- Sample

  * NHANES
      * 1/1/1999 to 12/31/2012 (14 years)
      * 17 to 21 years (n=6,338)
      
    * Exclusions
        * pregnant (1.8%)
        * on lipid lowering medication (2.8%)
        
## Methods (2) -- Imputation

  1. Created 10 separate imputed data sets.
      * Calculate the proportion of participants with the guideline risk factors 
  2. Get frequency of risk factors in the source population of interest
      * Combine those 10 different estimates to create a composite representing the imputed subgroup frequencies in a nationally representative sample of the United States.
  3. Estimate the number of people with these characteristics
      * With those subgroup frequencies, apply to the estimated number of people ages 17-21 years in the United States.

## Results (1)

Percentage treated ages 17-21:

| | Pediatric | Adult |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Percent (95% CI) | 2.5 (1.8 to 3.2) | 0.4 (0.1 to 0.8) | 
| Count (of 20.4 million) | 483,500 (482,100 to 484,800)  | 78,200 ( 77,600 to 78,700) |

## Results (1)

| Most common risk factors | Percent (95% CI)|
| -- | -- |
| Smoking | 55 (41-69) |
| Obesity | 68 (55-81) | 
| Low HDL-C | 48 (34-61) |


| | Pediatric | Adult | Fold Increase |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Male | 2.9 | 0.4 | $\frac{2.9-0.4}{0.4} = 6.25$ |
| Female | 2.1 | 0.4 | $\frac{2.1-0.4}{0.4} = 4.25$ |


<!-- Note: they interpreted fold change incorrectly.-->

## Discussion

* Disconnect between the two guidelines
    * A child could be on statins, transition to adult status, then no longer be eligible.
    * The example they give is a 20-year old obese male with LDL-C mg/dL, smokes cigarettes and family history of early ASCVD.


* Limitations
    1) Single point data collection vs multiple measurements after lifestyle efforts
    2) few participants with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL
    3) discarded self report of ASCVD
    4) self-report of family history of ASCVD
    

## Summary 

* Under pediatric guidelines many more treated (>400,000 people) if following guidelines

* Mostly likely an over-estimate
    * Mentions 'disagreement with recommendations'
    * adherence to medication regimen
    * uncertain state of knowledge


## Extra questions (1)

* Methods-related: Is the imputation for LDL a problem considering so many missing and no sensitivity analysis mentioned (for the imputation procedure)
      * LDL-C missing for 3,686 of the 6,338 participants (58.2% missing)
      * More imputation data sets?
      * Sensitivity analysis to departure from missing at random (MAR) assumption? [@hayati_rezvan_rise_2015]

## Extra questions (2)

* Given the range of time for estimates (1999-2010) how will these estimates change with temporal effects in child obesity prevalence?

* Gender differences in dyslipidemia tracking to adulthood.
    * Less tracking for females. Will this create a benefit-harm imbalance?
    
* 'Refractory to other interventions' (mentioned in Benuck [@@benuck_point:_2015])
    * This group could be the majority of children based on calculations in Gooding paper.
    * As pointed out in Benuck the economic health costs are unknown.
    * As pointed out by Belamarich [@belamarich_counterpoint:_2015], these families may not come back for follow-up.
    * How will this screening work in practice?

<!-- Add in more points from two point/counterpoint papers.-->


<!-- TO DO: look up the ways to conduct sensitivity analyses for imputation. and what effects could there be? -->


## Extras

### Friedewald equation

*This equation is based on an analysis of 448 patients from 1972 and estimates LDL-C as*

\[
  \textrm{TC} - \textrm{HDL-C} - \frac{\textrm{TG}}{5}
\]

*in mg/dL. The final term assumes a fixed ratio of triglyceride levels to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG:VLDL-C) of 5:1. [@martin_comparison_2013]*

* TC = total cholesterol
* HDL-C = high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
* TG = triglycerides
